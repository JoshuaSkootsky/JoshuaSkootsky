         Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
         Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
    Only this and nothing more.”
            
                 Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
                 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
                 Eagerly I wished the morrow; 
                 —vainly I had sought to borrow
                  From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
                  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                  Nameless here for evermore.
                  
                  </pre>
