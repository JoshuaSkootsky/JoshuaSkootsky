### 👋 Hi there 

I'm Joshua Skootsky

I build websites and web apps. I also set up automated pipelines for testing and delivery. Together, these skillsets allow me to write software that correctly fulfills requirements on time.

My peers say I'm effective in building rapport with diverse personalities, and I believe this skill is essential to creating successful teamwork in the digital environment.

I have been:

* a Python dev
* a Java dev
* a database schema designer
* full stack software engineer
* Front end HTML/CSS fixer
* Software Engineer
* Typescript lover
* React reactor
* Vue viewer
* Meteor metoer'er (RIP Meteor.js?)
* "the DevOps guy"
* "the tests guy"
